## Directory Overview

- **Template/**  
  Ready-to-use C++ code templates for various problem types, including bit manipulation, randomization, and interactive problems. Useful for quickly setting up solutions in contests.

- **Strings/**  
  Algorithms for string processing, such as KMP, Aho-Corasick, hashing, and palindrome detection.

- **Graphs/**  
  Graph algorithms and data structures, including BFS, Dijkstra, LCA, DSU, centroid decomposition, SCC, and 2-SAT.

- **NumberTheory/**  
  Number theory utilities like the Chinese Remainder Theorem, modular inverses, and prime sieves.

- **Combinatorics/**  
  Combinatorial algorithms and utilities, including matrix operations, dynamic programming for combinations, and nCr calculations.

- **DataStructures/**  
  Advanced data structures such as segment trees (various types), Fenwick trees, persistent structures, Mo's algorithm, HLD, and stacks.

- **DynamicProgramming/**  
  Dynamic programming techniques, e.g., SOS DP.

- **FFT/**  
  Fast Fourier Transform and Number Theoretic Transform implementations for polynomial multiplication and related problems.

- **Theorems/**  
  Visual and code resources for mathematical theorems, including illustrative images.

- **Tester/**  
  Tools for testing and validating solutions, including generators, naive solutions, and test scripts.

## Usage

- Each directory contains C++ source files focused on a specific topic.
- Files are named according to the algorithm or data structure they implement.
- Templates can be copied as a starting point for new problems.
- The `Tester` directory provides scripts and sample code for stress-testing and comparing solutions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algonima.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired directory** for the algorithm or data structure you need.
3. **Compile and run** the C++ files as needed:
   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 your_file.cpp -o your_program
   ./your_program
   ```
